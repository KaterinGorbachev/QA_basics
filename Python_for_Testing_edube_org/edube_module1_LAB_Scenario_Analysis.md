1. **Identify at least three risk factors in each scenario and explain the possible consequences if these risks are not mitigated during testing**

**Scenario 1: E-commerce Platform Feature Rollout**

Your team is developing an e-commerce platform that has recently implemented a new payment integration feature, enabling users to choose from multiple payment methods, such as credit cards, digital wallets, and cryptocurrency. To quickly align with a market trend, this feature was developed under a tight timeline, with junior developers tasked with coding essential security elements of the payment gateway. Due to the rushed schedule, comprehensive security testing was deprioritized, raising potential concerns about the robustness of the implementation.

**Scenario Analysis**

* **Developing under a tight timeline**  
  * Risk Factor: Insufficient unit and regression testing  
  * Possible Consequences: Critical bugs may go undetected until later stages, where fixing them is more costly and time-consuming. This could also delay release schedules or cause post-release hotfixes  
  * Mitigation Strategies:   
    * Prioritize critical test cases (risk-based testing) to ensure high-risk areas (payment validation, checkout flow) are covered first.  
    * Automate unit and regression tests where possible to save time.  
        
* **Team of junior developers**   
  * Risk Factor: Limited experience with complex payment integration and security best practices, lack of deep knowledge of the project   
  * Possible Consequences: Higher chance of faulty implementation, poor error handling, or improper integration with third-party APIs. This may lead to transaction failures and degraded user experience  
  * Mitigation Strategies:   
    * Establish clear coding standards and checklists for payment-related features.  
    * Introduce mandatory peer reviews before merging code.  
        
* **Absence of comprehensive security testing**  
  * Risk Factor: Incomplete validation of payment flows, encryption, and data protection measures  
  * Possible Consequences:   
    * Potential leakage of sensitive user data (credit card numbers, wallet credentials, address).  
    * Financial fraud and chargeback issues.  
    * Negative user feedback, loss of trust, and reputational damage.  
    * Legal and financial penalties for non-compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).  
  * Mitigation Strategies:   
    * Perform dedicated security testing (penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, fuzz testing).  
    * Enforce encryption standards (TLS for data in transit, AES for data at rest).  
    * Integrate static code analysis tools to detect insecure code (SonarQube, Fortify Static Code Analyzer, Checkmarx, Veracode).

    

**Scenario 2: Healthcare Scheduling App Update**

Your team has been updating a healthcare scheduling app to include new time zone functionality, allowing patients to book appointments with doctors internationally. This time zone logic was added at the last minute by a team member unfamiliar with the app's architecture. To save time, integration testing with the back-end scheduling system was skipped, and the update was rushed to coincide with a marketing campaign, potentially compromising the stability of the feature.

* **Logic for a new functionality was added at the last minute by a team member unfamiliar with the app's architecture**  
  * Risk Factor: Limited understanding of existing architecture and dependencies, substitution of existing functionality   
  * Possible Consequences: even minor error can cause a critical bug due to the limited view of the whole picture:   
    * Introduction of hidden defects or breaking changes.  
    * Conflicts with existing scheduling logic (e.g., incorrect calculation of appointment times).  
    * Critical bugs caused by overlooking system-wide impacts.  
  * Mitigation Strategies:  
    * Implement mandatory code reviews with senior developers familiar with the architecture.  
    * Document architecture and dependencies for easier onboarding and safer updates.  
    * Use static analysis tools to detect potential dependency or logic conflicts (PVS-Studio, SonarQube, ESLint, Pylint)  
        
* **Integration testing with the back-end scheduling system was skipped**  
  * Risk Factor: Lack of verification of data flow and API compatibility, assuming the feature works without full end-to-end testing  
  * Possible Consequences:   
    * Time zone mismatches leading to double-bookings or missed appointments.  
    * Incorrect synchronization between front-end and back-end schedules.  
    * Poor user experience and potential harm to patients if medical appointments are missed.  
  * Mitigation Strategies:  
    * Perform end-to-end integration testing before release, especially around core booking workflows.  
    * Automate regression testing for time zone conversions across different regions.  
    * Use mock APIs during development to validate integration early.  
    * Create test cases covering edge cases (e.g., daylight saving time changes, international time differences).

* **Updated in a rush**  
  * Risk Factor: Incomplete verification of deployment stability and regression risks  
  * Possible Consequences:  
    * Unchecked edge cases could result in negative user feedback.  
    * Existing scheduling functionality could break.  
    * Emergency hotfixes may be needed, increasing development costs.  
    * Negative customer perception if the marketing campaign promotes a faulty feature.  
  * Mitigation Strategies:  
    * Separate release planning from marketing timelines to avoid rushed deployments.	  
    * Maintain rollback procedures to quickly revert if deployment issues occur.  
      

**Scenario 3: Social Media Platform Algorithm Update**

Your team recently deployed a new content recommendation algorithm on a social media platform, designed to prioritize trending content. However, the algorithm was not fully evaluated for bias and fairness. Quality checks on user feedback data were incomplete, and only a small set of test users provided feedback before deployment. Additionally, potential legal implications related to content prioritization were not reviewed, which could pose regulatory challenges.

* **The algorithm was not fully evaluated for bias and fairness**  
  * Risk Factor: Lack of comprehensive validation and fairness testing  
  * Possible Consequences:   
    * Functionality results are erroneous.   
    * Biased content recommendations (e.g., favoring certain demographics or viewpoints).  
    * Negative user perception and dissatisfaction due to unfair or irrelevant content.  
    * Public backlash and reputational damage.  
  * Mitigation Strategies:  
    * Establish monitoring dashboards to detect bias or skew in live recommendations.

    

* **Incomplete quality checks on user feedback data**  
  * Risk Factor: Insufficient test coverage and poor validation of collected feedback  
  * Possible Consequences:   
    * Misinterpretation of user sentiment, leading to flawed improvements.  
    * Defects discovered later in production, increasing fix costs.  
    * Poor user experience due to undetected usability issues.  
  * Mitigation Strategies:  
    * Incorporate usability testing and exploratory testing sessions before release.  
    * Automate feedback data quality checks (duplicate detection, anomaly filtering).  
        
* **Potential legal implications related to content prioritization were not reviewed**  
  * Risk Factor: Absence of documentation verification, lack of compliance and regulatory assessment  
  * Possible Consequences:  
    * Violations of digital services or anti-discrimination regulations.  
    * Financial penalties and legal disputes.  
    * Loss of user trust if platform is accused of unfair or manipulative practices.  
  * Mitigation Strategies:  
    * Maintain thorough documentation of algorithm decision-making and change history.  
    * Implement transparent user-facing policies explaining how recommendations work.  
    * Perform regular compliance audits aligned with local and international laws.

  **II.        For each scenario, identify one ISTQB principle that is most applicable to the issue and suggest solutions to address the potential risks highlighted by these principles.**


**Scenario 1: Mobile Banking App Update**

An update for a mobile banking app aimed at enhancing user experience was implemented, but due to time constraints, it was not tested on all supported devices.

ISTQB principle: Testing Is Context Dependent

Solution: focus testing on the most widely used devices and operating systems based on market statistics (e.g., StatCounter or app analytics). Additionally, apply risk-based testing by prioritizing devices most critical for security and customer usage.

**Scenario 2: Online Gaming Platform Load Test**

A new feature on an online gaming platform underwent thorough testing under average traffic conditions but was not stress-tested for peak usage scenarios.

ISTQB principle: Absence-of-errors fallacy

Solution: Testing should reflect real-world usage conditions, including peak and stress scenarios. Implement load and stress testing that simulates peak traffic (normal load \+ at least 10â€“20% buffer). This ensures the platform can handle spikes and provides confidence in scalability and resilience.

**Scenario 3: Customer Support Chatbot Integration**

A new chatbot was integrated into a customer support system to improve response times. However, its responses were only checked for grammatical accuracy, not for logical consistency or handling of unusual queries.

ISTQB principle: Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence

Solution: Design test-cases based on real technical support experience, on real customer service logs and edge cases (e.g., ambiguous, emotional, or unexpected queries).
